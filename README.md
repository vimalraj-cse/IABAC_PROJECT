 Thanks for uploading the file! Based on the filename `INX_Future_Inc_Employee_Performance_CDS_Project2_Data_V1.8.xls`, it looks like this is related to an employee performance dataset—possibly for a data science or analytics project.

Here's a general `README.md` content draft for such a project. Let me know if you'd like to customize it further based on project goals, model details, or team members.
