    "  - Provides an overview of the density and concentration of data at different levels.\n",
    "  - Helps identify trends, patterns, and potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insights Derived:**  \n",
    "  - The distribution plots reveal the overall density and majority of data for various features.  \n",

    "### **2. Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "Correlation analysis was performed using **bar plots** and **heatmaps** to visualize the relationships between numerical features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methodology:**  \n",
    "  - Used **Pandas `.corr()`** function to calculate the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** for pairwise relationships.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Key Observations from the Correlation Heatmap:**  \n",
    "  1. **Total Work Experience & Job Level:**  \n",
    "     - A high correlation indicates that employees with more experience are likely to be in higher job levels.  \n",
    "  2. **Experience at the Company & Years with Current Manager:**  \n",
    "     - Strong correlation suggests that longer tenure in the company often aligns with prolonged reporting to the same manager.  \n",
    "  3. **Experience at the Company & Experience in Current Role:**  \n",
    "     - Correlation here highlights that employees tend to gain deeper expertise in their current roles over time.  \n",
    "  4. **Experience & Promotions:**  \n",
    "     - Employees with longer tenure have a higher probability of receiving promotions, as evident from the correlation.  \n",
    "  5. **Age & Total Work Experience:**  \n",
    "     - A strong correlation aligns with the universal truth that age is directly related to overall work experience.  \n",

    "By combining distribution analysis and correlation heatmaps, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of how features interact. These insights are instrumental in building a predictive model and making data-driven decisions."
